## Threat Detection

### Understanding Threat Classifications

CyberGuard AI classifies threats into seven categories:

1. **Phishing** 🎣
   - Email-based social engineering attacks
   - Suspicious links or attachments
   - Credential harvesting attempts

2. **Brute Force** ⚡
   - Multiple failed login attempts
   - Password guessing attacks
   - Credential stuffing

3. **Malware** 🦠
   - Suspicious file execution
   - Unauthorized process behavior
   - File integrity violations

4. **Lateral Movement** 👁️
   - Unauthorized network traversal
   - Privilege escalation attempts
   - Unusual access patterns

5. **Data Exfiltration** 📤
   - Unauthorized data access
   - Large data transfers
   - Suspicious export activities

6. **Privilege Escalation** ⚡
   - Unauthorized privilege elevation
   - Sudo/admin command abuse
   - Role elevation attempts

7. **Unknown** ❓
   - Unclassified security events
   - Anomalous behavior
   - Requires manual review

### Risk Scoring

Risk scores (0-100) indicate threat severity:

| Score | Level | Action |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 0-40 | Low | Monitor |
| 41-60 | Medium | Investigate |
| 61-80 | High | Urgent response |
| 81-100 | Critical | Immediate action |

### MITRE ATT&CK Framework

Each threat is mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques for standardized threat intelligence:

- **T1110** - Brute Force
- **T1566** - Phishing
- **T1566.002** - Phishing: Spearphishing Link
- **T1547** - Boot or Logon Autostart Execution
